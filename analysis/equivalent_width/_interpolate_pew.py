    """Interpolate time dependent equivalent widths

    Interpolate equivalent width values to determine the value at the time
    of B band maximum.

    From Folatelli et al. 2013:

    When several measurements are available within one week before and after
    the time of maximum, a smooth polynomial fit is used. If only two data
    points were obtained encompassing maximum light within −4 and +4 days,
    then an interpolation was performed. If only data before or after maximum
    is available within [−7, +7] days, an extrapolation is performed if the
    closest point to maximum light is not farther than one day. For
    observations which only have one measurement in the range [−4, +4] days or
    when measurements in that range do not encompass maximum light, average
    slopes determined from the best observed SNe are used for correcting the
    pW value to the time of maximum light.

    Args:
        time (ndarray): A list of observation times for each equivalent width
        ew_vals (list): A list of equivalent width values
        tmax   (float): Time of maximum to interpolate for

    Returns:
        The equivalent width interpolated at ``tmax``
