Photometric Constraints on SNe Models with LSST
===============================================

This documentation outlines the analysis package used for the NIR Comparison
project. The project goal is compare SNe models against data from CSP to
understand how well we can constrain spectroscopic models with photometric
data, particularly with upcoming surveys like LSST.
